# How to Repair a Drone

So you wanna fix a drone? They come in with loads of problems: 

_Start with dead animation, then reverse?_

- Jostling
  - We have to re-orient some parts that get knocked out of place. Use your rad-dial to rotate the specified part until it clicks into place!
- Rewiring
  - Sometimes we need to run cable through the drone. Use your rad-dial to run the specific type of cable. 
- Replacement
  - Sometimes we just need to replace a part, like a power brick. Find it in the pile of items and slap it in - if we need more than one, go for it!
- Rebuilding
  - Sometimes we need to rebuild a component. Find its constituent parts and assemble them using your rad-dial. 
- Refueling 
  - Some components need to be refueled, which requires us to process the raw fuel bricks first; this requires us to coordinate diagnostics to properly break up the item. Think of it like whack-a-mole! 
- Charging
  - Sometimes the drone just needs a charge. Use your rad-dial to charge it!

After each process below, the player's rad-dial returns to the top level (nav dial). 

## Reorienting

When a component is jostled, it needs to be re-oriented. The player follows the process below to repair the drone in this way. 
- Select the "Re-Orient" slice of the rad-dial. 
- Select the appropriate item from the sub-dials, as indicated in the drone display. 
- Slide a finger around the ring of the terminal dial until the interface indicates a success. 

## Rewiring

When a component is in need of re-wiring, cable needs to be run between two components. The player follows the process below to repair the drone in this way. 
- Select the "Re-Wire" slice of the rad-dial
- Select the appropriate cable from the sub-dial
- Slide a finger between the source and destination, navigating obstacles as required. 

## Replacement

When a component is in need of replacing, the drone will lack the item but a dimmed version of its icon will be visible. 
- Select the "Replace" slice of the rad-dial
- Select the appropriate item from the sub-dial. 
- Select the correct quantity of item to replace. 

## Rebuilding

When a component needs to be rebuilt, multiple sub-items need to be selected to combine into the new component. 
- Select the "Rebuild" slice of the rad-dial
- Select the first appropriate item from the sub-dial. 
  - After selecting the first item, the player's rad-dial is not returned to the nav dial, but instead to the first sub-dial under the "Rebuild" slice. 
- Repeat as required. 

## Refueling

When a drone needs to be refueled, its specific power source brick will require fuel to be processed. 
- Find the "Refuel" slice of the rad-dial 
- Select the appropriate energy source for the power brick
- Synchronize taps with the diagnostic sweeper to render the brick into cake, then powder. 
- Repeat as needed. 

## Recharging 

When a drone needs to be recharged, the player needs to recharge its power source. 
- Find the "Recharge" slice of the rad-dial
- Select the appropriate power brick
- Repeat the required motion to recharge the power brick.
